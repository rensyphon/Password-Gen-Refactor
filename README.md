# Password-Gen-Refactor

## Description

This project involved taking pre-written code and adding functionality to create a password generator. Specifically, this was the addition of a code that output prompts to the user, stored those values, then generated a random password based on those values.

The end goal is to create a browser-based password generator that will output a randomly created password based on parameters the user chooses. Upon opening the website and clicking "Generate Password," the user will be prompted to choose a password length and to decide what type of characters the password will contain. Afterwards, the user will be presented with a randomly generated password.
